- Excel (Google Sheets)
  - The VLookUp function can be used with a table of data, it uses the same concept as a hash table.
  - A pivot table is great for creating a better summary table for a larger and more extensive table. Great for creating cleaner reports.
  - Absolute Referencing is used to always reference a particular column and/or row by using the $, for example, $A5 would always reference a cell in the A column but row 5 will update dynamically.

    - Stay Calm
    - Rewind
    - Explain to myself
  - Section 2 (What is Discrete Math?)
    - Working with a finite set
  - Section 3 (What is a set?)
    - A collection of distinct objects or elements or members
    - Elements could be numbers, letter, or symbols
    - Set contains elements
    - 5∈A (5 is an element in set A)
    - Curly Braces to contain the elements
    - C = {d,f,g} (C contains d,f,g)
  - Section 4 (Interval Notation and Common Sets)
    - x∈(0,1) O < x < 1
    - x∈\[0,1) O <= x < 1
    - Empty set is a circle with a diagnol line crossed through it
    - N = {1,2,3, ...}
    - N<sub>0</sub> = {0,1,2,...}

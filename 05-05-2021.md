- Sources of where I learned from:
  - [C++ Vectors](https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/c-plus-plus-vector)
  - [C++ Finding the length of an array](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-do-i-find-the-length-of-an-array-in-c-cplusplus)
 

- What I've Learned:
  - Vectors can work with dynamic data which means the number of elements can decrease or increase without defining how many elements can be stored.
  - Access Modifiers allows methods and/or variables of a class to be more or less accessible.
    - Private access modifier can only be used within the class and is not accessible from an inheritor or be used by an instance.
    - Protected access modifier can be used by the inheritor class but cannot be used in an instance.
    - Public access modifier allows the variable/method be accessible in a class' instance or in an inheritor.

/*
Leetcode - Solution for finding the maximum number of consecutive ones and the chain will be broken if a zero is encountered.
For Example:
[1,1,0,1,1,1,0] // 3
We got 3 as the output because there are 3 ones in a row without a zero breaking the chain.

class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int max = 0;
        int ones = 0;
        
        for (int num: nums) {
            if(num == 1) {
                ones++;
            }
            if(ones > max) {
                max = ones;
            }
            if(num == 0) {
                ones = 0;
            }
        }

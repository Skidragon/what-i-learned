# 05-08-2021 (Web Scraping and Pointers)
- Sources of where I learned from:
    - [Pointers in C/C++](https://youtu.be/zuegQmMdy8M)
    - [Scrape the Web with Node.js + Finding Undocumented APIs and Reversing Engineering Data Formats
](https://youtu.be/76d2yOMXmag)

- What I learned:
    - Pass by Reference vs Pass by value in C
        - When passing an array to a function, we only get a pointer to the starting address of the array in order to save memory
    - What is a string in C?
        - a string is an array of characters
    - How does C know when the string has ended and not keep going
        - We use a null which is represented by this '\0' at the last byte
        - For example:
        ```c
        char* str[6] = "Simon"; // the \0 is at the end implicitely that is why we put 6 instead of 5 to hold an extra value
        ```

    - Started on Trello board for web scraping and displaying it on a site and started on asking questions about legality, tools, and what I want to accomplish on the site.

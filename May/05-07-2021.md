- Sources of where I learned from:
    - [Exiting from EOF](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4358728/end-of-file-eof-in-c)
    - The C Programming Language PDF

- The C Programming Language
    - A preprocessing step performs macro substitution on program text, inclusion of other source files, and conditional compilation.
    - `#include <stdio.h>` tells the computer to include information about the standard input/output library; the line appears at the beginning of many C source files
    - symbolic constants start with a # and will be defined with UPPERCASE letters
        - For example: #TRUE 1

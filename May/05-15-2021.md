# 05-15-2021 (Styling, Axios, Loading and Error Handling with SWR, and Markdown)

## Sources From where I learned from:
- [SWR Docs](https://swr.vercel.app/)
- [Create Table of Contents in Markdown](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18244417//how-do-i-create-some-kind-of-table-of-content-in-github-wiki)
- [How to get Error Response from Axios](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39153080/how-can-i-get-the-status-code-from-an-http-error-in-axios)
- [Scrimba](http://scrimba.com/)

## What I learned:
    - Creating an overlay on top of an image with pseudo-element, opacity, and background-url.
    - Without a z-index value, any non-static positioned elements will be on top of the default static positioning elements.
    - Use vw unit for responsive negative spacing for content
    - SWR (stale-while-revalidate)
      - An HTTP cache invalidation strategy
        - Returns the state data in the cache if it exists while fetching for new data
    - error.response exists in error object from axios, I can get the status code from there.

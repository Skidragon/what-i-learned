# 05-09-2021 (Google Sheets, Notion, Web Scraping & C)

- Google Sheets
    - I discovered how to use TIMEVALUE function, it accepts a TIME argument and gives the fraction of the 24 hour day
        - For example, if I do `=TIMEVALUE(TIME(06,00,00))`, I would receive .25 since 6 hours of the 24 hour day has elapsed.
        - What I used it for?
            - Needed to have a calculation to know my eating and fasting window for the day.
- Notion
    - Learned how to use their templates, particulary for project planning and sprint setup.
- Web Scraping
    - Learned the basics of going through the terms of service and robots.txt file to see if there are any legal issues for scraping.
    - Reviewed the basics before starting the project tomorrow.
- C
    - Heap
        - A memory pool
    - Ways we can allocate memory in the Heap
        - malloc
            - void malloc(size_t size)
            - int \*p = (int*)malloc(10\*sizeof(int)) //casting example
            - Creates a memory space in the heap
            - Does not initialize values
            - Must use sizeof to get the amount of memory wanted
            - Must use casting in order to specify what data type that memory block will be using
        - calloc
            - void * calloc(size_t num, size_t size)
            - Same as Malloc in that it creates a memory space in the heap
            - Initializes values to 0s at the call of the function for the empty spaces in memory
        - realloc
            - able to extend or shorten existing memory
            - de-allocates memory automatically if shortened
            - finds new place in memory if cannot extend any further at current address
        - free
            - must be called to free memory in the heap
            - c will not garbage collect automatically even after exiting the function in the stack unless the whole program ends
    - Different types of memory to be aware of
        - Heap
        - Stack
        - Static/Global
        - Code Text (Instructions)
    - Multi-dimensional Arrays
